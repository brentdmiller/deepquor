/* Idea:
 * We'll construct a large array enumerating every possible wall location.
 * Then we'll use prev/next pointers in the elts of that array to link all
 * elts arbitrarily into a large doubly-linked list.
 * During move evaluation, we'll have a stack of moves, and each stack
 * frame will contain the position at that frame, a move, and list of
 * other possible wall moves that were eliminated by that move.
 * When we add a new move to the stack, we look up the wall positions
 * eliminated by that move, snip them from the possible wall move list
 * and insert them into that frame's "eliminated wall move list."
 * When we work our way back up the move stack and undo that move, we
 * insert the frame's eliminated wall move list" back into the possible wall
 * move list.
 * Note that as the game progresses, we can boost performance slightly by
 * regenerating the list of each wall move's "blocked" moves.  This can be
 * done by re-initializing the move stack from the current position.
 *
 * Further optimization: ???
 * after we've created an initial lookahead tree (qcomptree), maintaining
 * the list of possible wall moves might not be worthwhile as we walk up and
 * down the lookahead tree.  The lookahead tree already has possible moves
 * cached for previously visited positions.  Perhaps we should have the
 * ability to "bind" and "unbind" calculation of wall moves, so we can
 * turn off wall move list maintenance while walking up and down the
 * lookahead tree.  When we reach and end node of the tree and want to
 * start evaluating new territory, we'd call initWallMoveTable() for the
 * current position, turn on the wall list functionality, and proceed.
 *
 * I suspect that, except for very deep positions, it's faster to just
 * maintain the wall list.  Ballpark estimate figures:
 *
 * operations required to get list of possible wall moves for a position:
 *   128 (maybe this can be optimized)
 * 
 * operations required to update wall list when a move is made:
 *   4 x 2 (x2 because we have to remove the moves and then replace them later)
 *
 * So a back-of the envelope estimate is that we'd have to walk about 16
 * plies from a pre-computed lookahead tree before turning off wall
 * maintenance was worthwhile.  16 plies is a lot!
