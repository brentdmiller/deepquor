/* The intent is to keep 20 position hashes, each one corresponding to the
 * number of played walls in the positions it contains.
 *
 * Whenever a player places a wall, we can throw away the smallest hash.
 * Since walls cannot be removed, we will not need it any more.
 * If the process is running out of memory, the 2 least expensive operations
 * for freeing memory are (1) throw away the smallest heap (since it mostly
 * contains previously computed positions...the only positions we can
 * actually reach are by pawn moves and they only account for about 4%
 * of the positions); and (2) throw away the 20-wall heap (it is
 * easy to recompute because there are no more walls available).
 *
 * In fact, upon reaching a position with 20 walls placed, we should probably
 * discard the 20-wall heap once to purge all the unreachable positions.
 * This discard could be skipped if there is too little time on the clock
 * and memory to spare.
 *
 * If additional free memory is needed, we can then throw out the 19-wall
 * heap, followed by the 18-wall, ....   The idea is that even if we throw
 * away a high-numbered heap, the scores of it's positions will already
 * have been copied to "lower" positions and most of them are probably
 * no longer needed.  Another strategy that might be worth trying is to
 * throw away heaps at odd intervals, keeping every other or every Nth
 * heap.  The idea is that it's easy to regenerate a position's score from
 * the neighboring positions.  By throwing out every other heap, we will
 * avoid needing to regenerate many layers of neighbors to recalculate the
 * score for a discarded position.

 * Because the intent is to use a different hash table for each number     *
 * of played walls, and blow away entire tables whenever a wall is played, *
 * our hash structure is made to be efficient at getting new one-elt       *
 * allocations (for storing new positions) and destroying entire hashes,   *
 * but we don't worry too much about speed or efficient memory use when    *
 * freeing single elts.  We don't worry about decreasing a hash's          *
 * memory footprint until the entire hash is destroyed.                    *
 *                                                                         *
 * Thus, this hash type is good at growing new value elements one-at-a     *
 * time as needed, and it can be destroyed in O(1) time; but it is not     *
 * memory-efficient if individual elements are often removed.              *
